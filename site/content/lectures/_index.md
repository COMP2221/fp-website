# Lecture slides and video links

As the course progresses, I'll upload lecture slides, the live code
examples, and add links to the videos (accessible with a Durham
account) here.

- 2021-01-12: [Annotated slides]({{< static-ref
  "slides/2020-21/Lec01.pdf" >}}),
  [video](https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c27a685e-8450-417b-8eda-acae00dc4ebc),
  [code]({{< code-ref "lectures/Lec01.hs" >}})
  
  We got about halfway through the slides, we'll pick up where we left
  off next time.
