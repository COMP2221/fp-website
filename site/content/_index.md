# COMP2221: Functional programming

This is the course webpage for the functional programming part of
[COMP2221]({{< modulepage >}}). It collects the exercise sheets,
syllabus, and lecture slides. The source repository is [hosted on
GitHub]({{< repo >}}).

The goal of the course is to provide an introduction to the [functional
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
language, [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org). We will introduce the
language and also try and show how developments in Haskell are adopted
by other (perhaps more mainstream) languages, and why you might care.

## Course organisation

The revision lecture will take place on Monday, 25/04/22, in D/PH8 (Physics) at 4pm.

You can attend remotely over [zoom](https://durhamuniversity.zoom.us/j/94501248637?pwd=TmRRME4rbzRON3cyODNwc1BJT2xudz09), and will need to be
authenticated with your Durham account.

### Running code

I will do a bunch of live coding during the lectures. You're
encouraged to play around with things afterwards to make sure you
understand stuff. All of the code will appear in the [course
repository]({{< repo >}}) in `./code/lectures/2021-22/`.

### Practical sessions

There are five weeks of practical sessions which will start in the
first week of term. We'll cover the [exercises]({{< ref
"exercises.md" >}}), and any other queries you might have.

{{< hint warning >}}

In the first week of term (week beginning 10th January), practicals
are **online only**.

### Discussion forum

I have set up a [discussion forum]({{< repo >}}/discussions) where you
can ask, and answer, questions. You'll need a
[GitHub](https://github.com) account to use it, but you've all got one
of those already, right? Note that this repository and forum is
publicly visible.

### Office hours

Open office hours (no appointment needed) will be advertised here.

If you need to get in touch some other time, please [email
me](mailto:lawrence.mitchell@durham.ac.uk) to arrange something.

### Other feedback routes

Feel free to ask questions in the live sessions if you want, I will
try and get to them all. You can of course, always [email
me](mailto:lawrence.mitchell@durham.ac.uk). Finally, I've set up a
[feedback submission
form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=i9hQcmhLKUW-RNWaLYpvlH6j_ORl2wpMpbvCR6TejgNUNU5HMkk0TDFGQTNKMTRTVTJFRlNCSjQwNi4u)
(which records responses anonymously, though you'll need to be signed
in with you Durham account) for you to optionally comment on things
that were good, bad, or you didn't understand about the lectures.

## Further resources

A recommended textbook for the course is Graham Hutton's [_Programming
in Haskell_](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html). Some
hardcopies are available [in the
library](https://library.dur.ac.uk/record=b2094512~S1).

In addition, there a number of excellent introductory Haskell
tutorials, which you may find enlightening (if you don't like my
explanations).

The [Haskell wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/) links to a number of
[tutorials](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learning_Haskell#Online_tutorials).

A slightly cutesy, but nonetheless well-explained, introduction is
provided by [learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com).
