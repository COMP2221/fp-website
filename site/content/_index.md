# COMP2221: Functional programming

This is the course webpage for the functional programming part of
[COMP2221]({{< modulepage >}}). It collects the exercise sheets,
syllabus, and lecture slides. The source repository is [hosted on
GitHub]({{< repo >}}).

The goal of the course is to provide an introduction to the [functional
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
language, [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org). We will introduce the
language and also try and show how developments in Haskell are adopted
by other (perhaps more mainstream) languages, and why you might care.

## Course organisation

The course starts on Monday, the 9th of January 2023, at 3 pm in TLC033.

<!--### Running code

I will do a bunch of live coding during the lectures. You're
encouraged to play around with things afterwards to make sure you
understand stuff. All of the code will appear in the [course
repository]({{< repo >}}) in `./code/lectures/2021-22/`.-->

## Lectures

Lectures take place in the first half of term 2 as follows:

| Date/time          | Location |
|--------------------|----------|
| Monday 3pm--4pm    | TLC033   |
| Friday 1pm--2pm    | W103     |

Further, there is a revision lecture in the first week of term 3.

### Practical sessions

Practical sessions start in the second week of term 2.
The practical sessions cover the [exercises]({{< ref
"exercises.md" >}}) and take place as follows:

| Date/time          | Location |
|--------------------|----------|
| Monday 4pm--6pm    | CC0007    |
| Wednesday 9am--11am | RH025    |
| Thursday 9am--11am    | RH025    |
| Thursday 4pm--6pm    | RH025    |
| Friday 4pm--6pm    | RH025    |

Further practical sessions take place in the first week of term 3 to cover the content of the mock exam.

### Discussion forum

I have set up a [discussion forum]({{< repo >}}/discussions) where you
can ask, and answer, questions. You'll need a
[GitHub](https://github.com) account to use it, but you've all got one
of those already, right? Note that this repository and forum is
publicly visible.

### Office hours

Open office hours (no appointment needed) take place during term time on Wednesdays from 11:30 am to 12:30 pm in MCS 2025.

If you need to get in touch some other time, please [email
me](mailto:laura.morgenstern@durham.ac.uk) to arrange a meeting.

### Other feedback routes

Feel free to ask questions in the live sessions if you want, I will
try and get to them all. You can of course, always [email
me](mailto:laura.morgenstern@durham.ac.uk). 

## Further resources

A recommended textbook for the course is Graham Hutton's [_Programming
in Haskell_](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/pih.html). Some
hardcopies are available [in the
library](https://library.dur.ac.uk/record=b2094512~S1).

In addition, there a number of excellent introductory Haskell
tutorials, which you may find enlightening (if you don't like my
explanations).

The [Haskell wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/) links to a number of
[tutorials](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learning_Haskell#Online_tutorials).

A slightly cutesy, but nonetheless well-explained, introduction is
provided by [learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com).
