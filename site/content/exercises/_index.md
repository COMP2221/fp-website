# Overview

The exercises are a chance to try things out and get a handle on
writing Haskell code. For many of them, the correct answer is a quick
search away. Please do try and work on them a bit yourself first!
Should you get stuck, ask one of the demonstrators, or on the
[discussion
forum]({{< repo >}}/discussions).

Although they're divided into separate pages, there isn't a natural
one page per practical session division. The earlier stuff is easier,
but have a go at whichever bits you want.

If you want a bit more of a challenge, I can recommend (although it's
no longer the season) trying out your newfound Haskell skills solving
some of the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) problems.
