The exercises are a chance to try things out and get a handle on
writing Haskell code. For many of them, the correct answer is a quick
search away. Please do try and work on them a bit yourself first!
Should you get stuck, ask one of the demonstrators, or on the
[discussion
forum]({{< repo >}}/discussions).
