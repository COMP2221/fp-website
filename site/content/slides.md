# Lecture slides and video links

As the course progresses, I'll add the annotated slides and live code
examples, along with links to the videos (accessible with a Durham
account), and some commentary.

- 2022-01-10: [Annotated slides]({{< static-ref
  "slides/2021-22/Lec01.pdf" >}}),
  [video](https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=cefca3c8-328b-4b0e-b0a1-ae19011c7e90), [code]({{< code-ref "lectures/2021-22/Lec01.hs" >}})
  
  We got most of the way through the slides, and then did some live
  examples. We same some very simple functions and probably quite a
  lot of syntax that we'll go through in more detail as the course
  progresses.
  
  My editor was a bit angry fruit salad, which I've toned
  down for next time.
  
  I would encourage you to get a fancy editor setup so that you too
  can take advantage of the "code actions" I was using, these are
  provided through
  [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) by the
  [Haskell wingman](https://haskellwingman.dev).

  We finished off by going over the definition of `filter` we had seen
  at the end of the last session. I've updated the lecture 1 annotated
  slides above to include my new annotations (I wrote it out more
  neatly).
  
  We then did some introductory types and started hinting at the idea
  that function types, and especially higher-order functions, are very
  important. We got about halfway through the slides, and I'll pick up
  there next time.

  [Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/) has a fun talk
  about type errors, mostly in
  [javascript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat).
