# Lecture slides and video links

As the course progresses, I'll add the annotated slides and live code
examples, along with links to the videos (accessible with a Durham
account) to this page.

- 2024-01-08: [Slides]({{< static-ref
  "slides/2023-24/Lec01.pdf" >}}),
  [video](https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=8b716364-bbee-44ce-9c2f-b0ee00a69ac2), [code]({{< code-ref "lectures/2023-24/Lec01.hs" >}})
  
  We got most of the way through the slides, and then did some live
  examples. We defined and composed some very simple functions and saw a
  bit of Haskell syntax that we will consider in more detail as the course
  progresses.
  
  Please setup your Haskell programming environment (GHC + an editor/IDE of your choice), try some of the examples from the lecture and try to work your way through the first exercise before the practical sessions start next week.

  [video](https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=32ed956b-e58d-4524-ab71-b0f400c7305b), [code]({{< code-ref "lectures/2023-24/Lec02.hs" >}})
  
  We got most of the way through the slides, considered basic types, tuples and lists in Haskell. Further, we saw how to define functions with multiple arguments by packaging all arguments into a tuple or list.

  - 2023-01-15: [Slides]({{< static-ref
  "slides/2022-23/Lec03.pdf" >}}),
  [video](https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=5f0e10ee-8ccf-4c11-8954-b0f50095fda8), [code]({{< code-ref "lectures/2023-24/Lec03.hs" >}})
  
  We considered currying as an alternative to defining n-ary functions via tuples or lists, we compared curried and uncurried versions of the same functions during live coding. Further, we introduced lambda expressions and the infix notation.
  
- 2023-01-19: [Slides]({{< static-ref
  "slides/2022-23/Lec04.pdf" >}}),
  [video](https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=4838ab3a-abf4-4d07-b781-b0fb00961e7b), [code]({{< code-ref "lectures/2023-24/Lec04.hs" >}})
  
  We discussed list comprehensions in conjunction with generators and guard expressions. Further, we considered pattern matching and its limitations. We introduced the types of polymorphism and will continue there next time.
