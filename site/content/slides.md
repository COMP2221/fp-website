# Lecture slides and video links

As the course progresses, I'll add the annotated slides and live code
examples, along with links to the videos (accessible with a Durham
account) to this page.

- 2022-01-10: [Annotated slides]({{< static-ref
  "slides/2021-22/Lec01.pdf" >}}),
  [video](https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=cdb1e9c6-f338-4f60-acdb-af820094eda4), [code]({{< code-ref "lectures/2022-23/Lec01.hs" >}})
  
  We got most of the way through the slides, and then did some live
  examples. We defined and composed some very simple functions and saw a
  bit of Haskell syntax that we will consider in more detail as the course
  progresses.
  
  Please setup your Haskell programming environment (GHC + an editor/IDE of your choice), try some of the examples from the lecture and try to work your way throuhg the first exercise before the practical sessions start next week.
