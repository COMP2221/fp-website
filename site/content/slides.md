# Lecture slides and video links

As the course progresses, I'll add the annotated slides and live code
examples, along with links to the videos (accessible with a Durham
account), and some commentary.

- 2022-01-10: [Annotated slides]({{< static-ref
  "slides/2021-22/Lec01.pdf" >}}),
  [video](https://durham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=cefca3c8-328b-4b0e-b0a1-ae19011c7e90), [code]({{< code-ref "lectures/2021-22/Lec01.hs" >}})
  
  We got most of the way through the slides, and then did some live
  examples. We same some very simple functions and probably quite a
  lot of syntax that we'll go through in more detail as the course
  progresses.
  
  My editor was a bit angry fruit salad, which I've toned
  down for next time.
  
  I would encourage you to get a fancy editor setup so that you too
  can take advantage of the "code actions" I was using, these are
  provided through
  [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) by the
  [Haskell wingman](https://haskellwingman.dev).
